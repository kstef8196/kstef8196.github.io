# CIT 281 code Portfolio
## About
Throughout the term, we have been learning the basics of Github and uploading code we have been writing. For part of our projects, we used different picture apps such as 500px, Flickr, and Unsplash to generate images based on the keyword entered by the user. We also worked with the Youtube API to generate videos based on what was entered by the user. Once our projects were completed, we pushed our code to Github and created project pages with different themes.
